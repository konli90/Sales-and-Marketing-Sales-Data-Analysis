# Sales and Market Share Analysis using Excel

As the Business Intelligent Analyst, I was directed by the CMO of VarnArsdel, a fictitious manufacturing company to analyze the sales and market share data of the company and its competitors. He wants to keep an eye on the companyâ€™s performance both internally and externally.

The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive electronic products that could be used for fun as well as work and it sells them directly to consumers nationwide as well as several other countries. VanArsdel and its competitors have retained a 3rd party marketing company to collect and anonymize industry sales so that all participants can benchmark themselves.

# To gather insights on how the company is performing as regards to sales and market share, I was directed to provide answers to the following questions;

1. What is the Market Share of our company (VanArsdell)? What is the market share of all the manufacturers across the different countries?

2. What is the Revenue Trend across all Manufacturers?

3. What is the Sales Distribution in the US?

4. Revenue Trend & Year-on-Year Growth.



# The processes I took in other to provide answers to the above questions are:

* Cleaned the data using Power Query and merging necessary tables to overcome ambuguity

* Loaded the datasets to Power Pivot due the large amount of data with the sales data having more than 7 million rows

* Created relationships; data modeling between the tables via the Diagram View of Power Pivot using many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
